## 5. Features / Highlights
• Business Problem
A retail company observed changes in customer purchasing patterns across demographics, product categories, and subscription behavior. However, raw transactional data made it difficult to answer questions such as:
Which customer segments drive the most revenue?
How does subscription status impact spending?
Which categories and age groups perform best?
What factors influence repeat purchases and customer loyalty?

To create an end-to-end analytics solution that:
Identifies customer purchasing and revenue trends,
Analyzes subscription behavior and its impact on sales,
Segments customers based on age, category, and behavior,
Supports data-driven marketing and product optimization decisions,
